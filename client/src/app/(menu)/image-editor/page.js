								Online image tools vs. desktop apps & software
							</h1>
							<p className="text-[14px] font-[500] text-justify mt-2">
								There are several benefits to using online image tools over
								mobile and desktop apps. Firstly, online tools are often more
								and quickly accessible, as they can be used from any device with
								an internet connection. They are also typically more affordable
								or even free, as they don't require installation or the purchase
								of a license. Quicktools is 100% free and doesnâ€™t require a
								sign-up.
								<br />
								<br />
								Finally, online tools can be updated and improved more quickly
								than desktop apps, meaning users have access to the latest
								features and functionality without the need for manual updates.

								Quicktools was born to provide quick solutions to people
								searching online. When searching for "resize image", you want to
								quickly resize your image, right?!
								<br />
								<br />
								In addition, there are many outdated tools that are not that
								very user-friendly, but our image tools are modern-looking and
								really easy-to-use.
								<br />
								<br />
								Since we are part of Picsart, we can offer these tools for free,
								but remember to check out the many other amazing tools and
