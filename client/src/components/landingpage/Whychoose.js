							When starting Quicktools, we noticed that other online tool
							providers needed to be more user-friendly, updated, and intuitive
							with new updates and enhancements. Our team wanted to change that.
							<br />
							<br />
							Since then, we have built 50+ tools with user-friendly experiences
							(not our words), modern looks, and up-to-date technologies. We
							always aim to develop world-class tools with the best user
							experience.
							<br />
							<br />
							Therefore, if you have any ideas, feedback, or annoying bugs,
							please reach out.
